## Illustrate
- [ ] OmniFuse is highly robust to the real scenario where both multi-source images exhibit composite degradation. Typical degradation types are considered, including inadequate illumination, noise, and color cast in visible images, and low contrast, noise, and uneven stripes in infrared images.
- [ ] OmniFuse supports language instructions to achieve fine-grained control over the fusion process, emphasizing semantic objects of interest, which potentially facilitates downstream semantic applications.
